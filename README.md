## Glad You Are Still There

### Ongoing Collection of Nature Webcams

While being sheltered in place, I wonder what it is like out there, in nature. I started to watch a lot of webcams live streaming animals on Youtube. Here are some of my personal favorites. There is a number at the bottom left of live streaming videos, showing how many people are watching it right now. The viewing number, along with the feeling that I am not alone, gives me comfort. Another favorite moment of mine is when the number drops to zero. The second when there is nobody but just me, the birds, the trees, the breeze, and the jumping frames, is the moment I feel grateful that they are still there.
